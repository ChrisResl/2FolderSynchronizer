# 2FolderSynchronizer

## A program for one-way synchroniziation of two folders

This program implements a folder synchronization tool that maintains an identical copy of a source folder in a replica folder. The synchronization is one-way and periodic, and file creation, copying, and removal operations are logged to both a file and console output. The folder paths, synchronization interval, and log file path can be provided using command line arguments.
